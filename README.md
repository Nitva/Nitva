# Hi there üëã

## Who am I?
First of all, I'm Pedro.  
I am starting my career as a Java developer, but I want to expand my knowledge to JavaScript, HTML, and Python.  
Right now, I am beginning to understand the basic principles of version control, work methodologies, and programming terminology, but  
I'm trying to immerse myself in documentation, papers, and everything related to programming.

## What am I doing right now?
I have just finished studying while working, and I want to continue learning, but in a relaxed way   
so I chose to follow a study plan on HyperSkill while working on random projects in my free time.

‚ù§Ô∏èThanks for your time / Gracias por su tiempo‚ù§Ô∏è
